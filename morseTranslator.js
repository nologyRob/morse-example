// Morse Code Translator Challenge - Pseudo Code Session

// How is this application going to work? How do we follow what we have learnt about 'best practice'?

// How will we achieve TDD?

// Where will we get our morse code data from? Ideas?

// How will we store it? How will we access it?


// Do we need to use a Switch statement? This switch statement would look at each english character and return the matching morse character?

// We are going to need an object.  The key is going to need to be the english letter and the value is going to need to be the corresponding morse character.

// We are going to need two input boxes on our application.  When one is typed into, the other will also change to the correct translation and vice versa.  We will be changing the value instead of the inner text/inner html. Extension

// I would expect my tests to look something like expect("a").toBe(".-") 

// I need a function that accepts a string and that same function will return a string but of the opposite language morse to english, english to morse (These are two different functions).

// A database file will be a good idea.  We could used default export for this or named export.

// Button with event listener

// Is uppercase different to lowercase in morse???
